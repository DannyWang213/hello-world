# hello-world
Just the intro, getting used to github.

Hi, software engineers and programmers!

I'm Danny, a high school student in his junior year. I've taken AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A, which I code in java. I'm taking PTLW Digital Electronics with Ardino, Web Development, Fundamentals of IT Infrastructure, Big Data: Warehousing and Analytics, and Cyber Security next year. It's a lot to take in but I definitely rather have my schedule filled with courses in the computer science field over any other fields.
